Building with Ant:

If you are using ant to build, you will need to run the following
command, either from within the project directory or by specifying
the path to the project directory:

android update project --path .

Alternately, set ANDROID_HOME to be the path to the Android SDK. On
OS X, you could do this by adding the following to your
~/.bash_profile file:

export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Development/android-sdk-macosx
